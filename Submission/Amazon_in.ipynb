Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...',\n",

Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.Macro camera - useless featureFront camera - AverageUi is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).FinalNormal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.Received 2nd one has battery draining issue.

       "  \"Thank you samsung and Amazon for timely rakshabandhan delivery.Now for readers this is a review unbiased and written after testing and continuous usage :-Pro's1.Screen ppi is great as entry level device✌2.Battery backup is awesome thanks to samsungs R&D even with .7mamp charger.👀3.Android go version 10 is cute without craps4.Reading pdfs is easy and comfort for eyes atleast samsung has guts to say the truth.5.No lag till now because i dont need gaming other than that all regular even without go apps are nicely running.6.fingerprint and face lock i dont need so good they are not provided.7.Call quality is okay.Speaker is normal.8.For music lovers dowload any music app with equilizer will be fine.9.16gb/32gb and sd card is okay.10.Auto smart memory cleaner(use smart manager in settings once a day) for smooth RAM functioning and ROM cleaning🤗11. Supports OTG as well.Cons1. Camera below average still expected but samsung should work more on this front if they wanna beat chinese phones.2.Not for gamers and thats expected buy a 4gb Ram 🤔 based phone why reading me?😉3.finger print and face lock missing I Can manage but most indians can't.4.Battery takes 3.15 hours to charge to work for 12 hours of calling and surfing and thats not bad at all but can be issue for chinese phone lovers who have habit of charging again and again to play pubg.Overall out of 5.Camera-2  Gui-4  Screen ppi-5  speed-4  android-4Don't buy a phone only because of specifications must see integration and longevity overall a nice secondary option and primary for featured phone switchers.\",\n",

Samsung Galaxy M01 mobile. Mobile is not worth. As today I came to amazon for return or replacement this cheater has closed the return window by yesterday. How cunning they are ? not even ten days its been since I have bought. This cheaters have closed it. Its not working now.  Even if I call toll free numbers no one responses.\",\n",

Again request a return. Waiting to see what happens now. Can not take it to any shop or dealer as it is purchased online.\",\n",
       "  \"After using 4/5 days suddenly without notice, the phone shutdown automatically and I couldn't restart it. So contact with amazon for replacing it and get very quick response from their end and they book a time slot to verify it by a technician. But after few hours later I found in start up guide send by Samsung,  how to restart when it stops working or hanged( by pressing power and volume key simultaneously for seven seconds or more). The fault is from the end of Samsung company I suppose, because they should mention the process on the front page with bold letter. Most of the reviews which get 1 star facing the same problems like of mine.  After using one month I want to add some extra points which impressed me.1. Sound quality and graphics are very good.2. Smooth touch sensitivity3. Ringtones are much louder.4.Two volte nano SIM s work fine together.5.Battery backup is good. Charging time is not so lengthy.6.Any SIM can be switched off manually, that impressed me.7. 2GB ram and 32 GB storage is better option for budget friendly people.8. I faced hanging problem for one day only till now , which can be easily solved by pressing volume down key and power key simultaneously for 7 seconds or more.8. Lastly this mobile is Made in India which I like the most.  So any one can go for it. Amazon agents are really helpful which I experienced.\",\n",

       "  \"This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\",\n",

       "  'Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.',\n",

       "  \"Honest review for a Honest Samsung phone. I am writing this review after using M31s for more than half month. And my verdict based on truly improved Samsung M series with my experience & tested after usage only.BUILD QUALITY. Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount. My hand is small but still I found 6.5 inches display is good to handle as it is well managed for one hand use also.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Now in M31s feature of Widevine L Certification you can enjoy all those global Dolby theatre experience. I found it reliable for my 1920p to 4k level of movie watching without any distraction due to Infinite O display which gives Full Screen Ratio. Fingerprint on side is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.BATTERY.Main benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough juice for nearly 3 days continuously. Tested.CAMERA.This time M series did a honest job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 64 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high & I found no complaints at all in focusing a shoot. Good color saturated. Well bright night shots. Macro shots r OSM. The depth & clarity of 64 megapixel is more developed in this M31s model. So no complaints.PROCESSOR.After using for more than half month I must say, Exynos 9611 works wonderful liquid speed when it is combined with LPDDR4X RAM technology. I have not faced any lag in PUBG or ASPHALT-9 hight end games, in medium setting which is good for battery saving. So 2.3Ghz speed accomplished. No complaints for the budget spent.SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.Bang for the bucks go for it. Thanks Amazon for Safe delivery.\",\n",
       "  'This is to share my horrible experience with Amazon and Samsung. The phone arrived dead and I have to make multiple calls, emails to team to get it replaced. After technician report confirming that phone is dead they now asking me to go for a refund as product is no longer in stock.',\n",
       "  \"Ordered on Prime day, 6th August 12 AM. Received the phone on 8th August.All aspects of the phone is on par or above the next segment.Display is gorgeous.Lookwise it doesn't feel like an M series phone.FP sensor works well although it can store only 3 fingerprints.Camera is overall good. Can't say it's a camera centric phone obviously. However it has some good outputs6000mah battery with 25W fast charging is awesome. (you get reverse charging as well).The only con i felt till now is the exclusion of a phone cover in the box. This might sound silly but I'm one of those guy's who use phone with a cover only to be on the safer side. Just because there is no cover I'm unable to use the phone as my daily driver right now.Come on Samsung. How much will a tpu cover cost for you?? 50Rs??M31s is actually A51 without on screen fp. It has better specs than A51 which retails around 8-9k than M31s which makes this phone one of a kind.The dimensions are also the same as A51. So you can use the same tempered glass but cant use A51 back cover for M31s since it should have the cutout for side mounted fp scanner.Overall a great phone. Value for money I should say. If you are not a heavy gamer this is the best choice around.Will update the review after using the phone for 2 weeks.Till then book your phone and wait for the delivery as it is back-ordered at this moment.\",\n",
       "  \"Strongly recommend No..why samsung make lot advertise on m31s.really don't know wt makes new compared to other M series.

Starting of series most of them said not  a gaming mobile.really its not gaming mobile.No samsung pay Nfc,No backcase,l.Rather than spending 20k on m31s supposed to switch another model.Name it as blur mobile.THANKS\",\n",

       "  'Initial impression after using for one day.1. The display is Gorgeous. Feels like a high end device2. Specs say 6000 MaH battery. Power management is not up to the mark. Without using any power intensive app battery drain is quite pronounced and noticeable.  Hopefully Samsung will release a patch to fix this3.Camera: Impressive.  Good lighting conditions result in beautiful and detailed shots. Struggles a bit during the low light conditions. Overall quite ok for the price.4. Processor: Not the fastest out there  but does the job. Nothing to complain about5. Fingerprint scanner is decent.6. No back case in the box. Will take time to get new case delivered.  Case is necessary as the back panel is quite slippery7. I believe the cost should have around 17K instead of 19.5k...! But if you want a non Chinese phone then this is a good option to consider',\n",

Same here samsung M30 again have gain..So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.6.sound is average,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound)Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.Thanks 👍\",\n",

       "  \"We haven't seen the ‘Prime' branding on a Redmi smartphone in a really long time, but now Xiaomi has brought it back with the Redmi 9 Prime. Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money? I review the new Redmi 9 Prime to find out.At the beginning of our Redmi 9 Prime review, we stated that the smartphone is a prime contender for the best smartphone under Rs 10,000 currently in India. Redmi 9 Prime is a budget all-rounder that ticks most boxes right with its value-for-money performance package.The camera unit may not be the best but it gets the job done. The lack of night mode is a bummer though. You can pick Xiaomi’s own Redmi Note 9 (review) that gets points for its big battery, decent display and an above-average performance unitI bought it for youtube review but it changed me\",\n",

It has a good camera which has multiple modes to click photos. It's front camera is top notch. I think if you get this phone for less than 20k by exchanging your old phone, it is totally worth it.It is a very light phone btw. Easy on the eyes and easy on the pocket.This is a day 1 review, first impression and a few hours of usage after full battery. It charges real quick btw.Shall update and edit this review in future if anything changes.Oppo has caught up with One Plus phones and with this budget phone, it has moved a step ahead.Buy it without any regrets if you can exchange an old phone and get this within 20,000.Go for it.\",\n",

       "  'I was looking for a budget smart phone which can perform the entire task for me. I was using MI note 6 and looking for something fresh bcz I was bored with it’s UI. I explored the content available over internet and waited for it to buy after getting the right fitment against my requirement. I am so excited to share my personal experience after my early purchase of this device. I love taking pictures of mine and surrounding too. So great camera quality is one of my main priority, after using it now I must say that it has the best camera available in this budget.It’s plastic made but mirror finish back panel is the coolest thing in my blue colour device. I also appreciate the makers for understanding our further need and offering the tempered glass and transparent back cover for device protection. Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo “Camera & Music” it really impressed me.I’ll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device. But there is also something which can be improved so writing it in bullet points for your ease..Pros:-● It’s really a 100% value for money device.● Run on latest version of Android “9”.● In Box soft back cover and tempered glass.● Dedicated kid mode for safety against unwanted operational activity of kids● Finger print sensor in back of the device is at perfectly placed in the reach of fingers and open the device faster.● 5000Ah battery, allows to watch many hours online video● HD+ screen Resolution and balanced colour contrast makes the viewing experience really pleasure and never hurt eyes● Triple camera with AI and image editing options are among the best features for me● Fast charging support with 18 watt inbox adaptor● Snapdragon 665 processor is really a power pack performer even in multitaskingCons:-● Lags in PubG (However in a device with 4 GB it’s expected as the game itself take 2 GB space)● No headphones included● Front Camera struggles in low light.At the price of 10990 its a great phone for better multitasking. Vivo has finally started improving specs and is doing good with their phones in the segment.I hope my review helped you in making your right decision!',\n",

But I use phone only for calls, whatsapp and sometimes Instagram. I use my laptop to watch movies, so not a big deal for me.  2) Unable to share Internet hotspot to computer/Laptop. But I posted a tip on how to solve this problem in MI community India. All you need to do is download an app called PDANet+ (available in Google play store) in both your phone and computer. Go and check it out.  Apart from the few drawbacks mentioned above, this phone is quite good for a budget phone. If you can live without the good video quality by watching movies/videos on another device, go for it. The 1440X720 resolution is much worse compared to Redmi 5a's 1280X720. In fact Redmi 5a's video/picture resolution is much better and detailed compared to Redmi 6a. Ordered and received another redmi 6a for my dad.\",\n",

Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\",\n",

The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3.

       "  \"Please don't buy it.It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.\",\n",

       "  \"Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.\",\n",

       "  \"Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.\",\n",
       "  \"It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.\",\n",
       "  'Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....',\n",
       "  \"Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:• Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.•Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.•60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅•Premium user-experience.•face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.•Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.•The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️*UPDATED*•Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)•Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.•No serious heating issues at all.•This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.•One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)\",\n",

Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money? I review the new Redmi 9 Prime to find out.At the beginning of our Redmi 9 Prime review, we stated that the smartphone is a prime contender for the best smartphone under Rs 10,000 currently in India. Redmi 9 Prime is a budget all-rounder that ticks most boxes right with its value-for-money performance package.The camera unit may not be the best but it gets the job done. The lack of night mode is a bummer though.

Currently except the 7i, no other phone is offering a 64mp camera sub-15k, I would suggest going for it's successor the realme 7 as it is a slight upgrade.Coming to the performance/looks/feel of the phone:It is a large device so don't be putting it in a small pocket.I think it is a bit on the heavier side, but not a very big issue.The colour comet white is pretty good looking too.Display is simply amazing and very immersive given that it's 90hz, makes it smooth. But here, I would like to warn you about a misconception you might have, not all apps support 90hz yet, so don't think that the phone is lagging, coz 60hz feels like lagging as compared to 90hz.I don't play games on my phone so can't grade the gaming performance of G90T and the optimisation/state of the phone while gamin' (altho G90T is very well known for it's gaming performance).The battery is pretty good, it should last you the whole day with about 20-30% left.The charging speed is mind blowing, +25% in about 15mins!Side mounted finger print sensor works well, BUT, the placing is such that it becomes iffy, but I guess it will be the case with all phones.In the current market this phone should be worth around 12-13k with all the offers applied (I mean 10% back offer), this is my valuation of the device.Lastly, I recommend people to use the back case provided to keep ur device safe. And also, if u can chuck out 17k from your pocket, then go for Poco X3.Cheerios!\",\n",

Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.

If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500.

You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.\",\n",

I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier.Good:- Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!!- Display is excellent with Blue light filter.- Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine.- 6000 Mah battery is BIG- 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot.- Both dedicated sim slots support LTE- Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast.- Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music.- Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere.- Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good- Received next day by 11 AM !Not So Good:- Not that thin, but ok.- Doesn't have Samsung Dex- Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all.- Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :)- Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them.Feedback- Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it.- Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now.Go for it without any doubt.\",\n",

       "  'Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone\\'s quality doesn\\'t meet the claims made.Cons:1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.3. Amazon\\'s Policy: In case you don\\'t like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day \"return\" policy to 10 day \"replacement\" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer\\'s site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.Pros:1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.',\n",

       "  \"Build and Design: 7/10Xiaomi’s mid-range devices have started to sport metallic builds. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A being an entry level device, comes with a polycarbonate finish. It weighs in at 131 grams and feels quite light, but sturdy to hold.The volume rocker and power/standby button on the right hand side give good feedback. The SIM card tray is located on the left hand edge. The phone measures around 8.5 mm thick.Xiaomi Redmi 4A ensures that there are no sharp edges on the phone, thanks to bevelled edges. This also helps in giving a good grip to the phone. On the rear of the phone there are fine grooves at the top and bottom, but it’s just a design element and it is not meant for antenna bands. The 13 MP rear camera is housed inside a metallic ring and is located on the top left hand corner with an LED flash unit beside it. The Mi branding is prominent on the lower half of the rear side. Towards the base there is a speaker grille section, with a minor chin just below it.The phone comes with an infrared blaster on the top edge, which also houses the 3.5 mm audio jack. At the base, you have a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. On the front there is a 5-inch HD display with thick bezels on the top and bottom.Overall, the build quality at this price point isn’t bad at all. The design is nothing out of the ordinary. The one-hand fit element will certainly attract a lot of buyers.Features: 7/10Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a 5-inch HD display and houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC with a quad-core Cortex A53 processor clocked at 1.4 GHz. The graphics portion is taken care of by an Adreno 308 GPU. The chipset is paired with 2 GB RAM. It comes in 16 GB and 32 GB storage variants. We got the 16 GB model to test, which gives around 10.3 GB of usable space. You can expand the storage using a microSD card by up to 256 GB.The Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes in a hybrid dual SIM configuration (micro SIM + nano SIM), supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS with A-GPS, GLONASS and BDS. It comes with a micro USB port for charging and data transfer, and there is no support for fast charging.Thankfully it bundles in an FM radio as well. On the camera front, you get a 13 MP rear camera, along with a 5 MP selfie camera. All this is powered by a non-removable 3,120 mAh Li-ion battery.Display: 7/10The Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a 5-inch IPS LCD display with a 1280x720 pixel resolution. While the colours look good and the viewing angles are fine, you do notice dithering on the text when you are using WhatsApp and other apps. This is particularly noticeable when the text size is selected as 'Small' from the settings menu.While watching videos, the sharpness and colour reproduction is quite good. Changing viewing angles only affects the brightness to an extent, but I didn’t notice any colour shifting. Sunlight legibility could have been better; you have no option but to boost up the brightness. Overall, the display is quite good for this segment of phones.Software: 7.5/10The phone comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow with MIUI 8 skin atop it. This was the same combination seen on the recently launched Redmi Note 4. The MIUI 8 skin has some minor additions over the MIUI 7, such as a smaller clock widget on the home screen, a redesigned notification and status bar (the status bar looks a lot more artistic on the MIUI 8), redesigned weather app and more.There aren’t many changes at a functional level, but just a minor revamp on the design front. One thing that stood out was the way the screenshot thumbnail floats on the top right hand corner of the screen after you take a screenshot. Taking a screenshot (holding down on the volume down and power button) would take a wee bit longer than usual. There is a definite lag one notices with the animations and when launching apps.It features an app called Second Space which has been out since last year. The app basically lets you create separate profiles for different use cases. For instance, you can have one mode for work and one mode for office — with different wallpapers, app icon arrangement, et al. It replicates another instance for you.Performance: 6/10This is an entry level phone, so as far as the regular tasks are concerned, it does not falter. The Snapdragon 425 SoC paired with 2 GB RAM fulfills all the needs of an entry level user. But the software glitches are noticeable on quite a few occasions. For instance, there were many instances when after getting done with a call, despite hitting the red coloured end call button, it would require two-three presses for the call to end. The response tends to be a bit delayed at times. I'm sure it's nothing that a future update cannot resolve.There is lag when switching between apps and while opening some heavy apps. Gaming is fine for casual games, don’t bother with heavy titles such as Asphalt 8: Airborne. Apart from the lag, it will also take up a lot of space on your phone — remember, you have only 10.3 GB usable. You can add a microSD card, thankfully.The phone does not heat much, unless you are running heavy apps onboard. At no instance during the testing did we notice any app shutting down due to overheating.In terms of benchmarks, there are no surprises here. The call quality is excellent and I faced absolutely no issues with that. The loudspeaker is quite poor though, you will be better off with a pair of good earphones.Camera: 6.5/10The Xiaomi Redmi 4A comes with a 13 MP rear camera with an f/2.2 aperture and a 5 MP front-facing camera with an f/2.2 aperture. The camera interface is similar to what we have come to expect from Xiaomi phones. There are a lot more filters to choose from, with some interesting ones such as Tunnel and Mirror. The manual mode only lets you adjust white balance and ISO. In the video mode, you only get the time-lapse mode (no slow motion recording).In terms of image quality, there is definitely a loss of sharpness when you are pixel peeping, and it is prominent around the edges. But for sharing on social media websites, the images are good enough. The HDR mode is not on by default, as it is with higher end Xiaomi phones. HDR mode when on, takes a couple of seconds to process the image.Also, over processing of images is noticeable in low light conditions, thereby giving them a waxy feel. Shooting post sundown is a challenge and the Redmi 4A is not really able to handle it well. But then again, this is an entry level smartphone, and for this price, you are getting quite a decent shooter, one that can put phones priced at twice the MRP to shame.Battery: 8/10There was a time when entry-level phones had not so impressive batteries, but not so anymore. Large capacity battery phones are coming in at increasingly affordable prices. The Xiaomi Redmi 4A for instance, packs in a 3,120 mAh battery, which is quite some capacity. The iPhone 7 Plus in comparison packs a smaller battery. Add in the fact that the 4A is powered by a low-power Snapdragon 425 SoC and the fact that is has an HD resolution screen.Together, this means that you can easily extract a work-day's worth of battery life out of the Redmi 4A. A battery charged around 12:30 AM lasted me till 6.30 PM on the next day, which is quite impressive. PCMark for Android gives around 12 hours 32 mins, which is again impressive.In fact on a light day I was even able to extract over a day and half worth of battery from the Redmi 4A.Verdict and Price in IndiaThe Xiaomi Redmi 4A is priced at Rs 5,999. At this price point, you are getting a lot of value for your money. The only challenge, rather, an irritant, with Xiaomi phones is their online-only open sale model where phones get sold out in seconds. It is quite annoying that Xiaomi hasn’t yet made the process of buying a smartphone online any easier. That seems to be a major roadblock and could easily put off many potential buyers. Xiaomi should understand that this isn't 2013 and that the competition has evolved.In terms of build quality, display, battery life, etc., the Xiaomi Redmi 4A is quite impressive. Yes, there is a noticeable lag in the user interface, but for someone who is moving from feature phone to a smartphone, that should not be as great an issue. The camera is great for daylight photographs, but low light shots leave a lot to be desired.In terms of competition at this price point, you have nothing that offers anything comparable. Sure, there are lots of devices under the Rs 6k price point, but they pale in comparison with the Redmi 4A. So if this is your first smartphone purchase, the 4A is definitely recommended.\",\n",

It has a polycarbonate matte-finished back or faux-metallic plastic, That actually looks like metal but made of plastic, which feels good in hand and exactly the same as we saw in Redmi 3s but it lacks the fingerprint security feature. It has a 5 inch HD Screen which has accurate colour reproduction and impressive viewing angles. The sunlight legibility is good too.

Same here samsung M30 again have gain..So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.6.sound is average,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days.

The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point.

Overall GOOD non Chinese phone.However, for their improvement, I tried to give some critical feedback to the company over phone but it was not so easy, so, I am writing here sothat Samsung India can take this critical review for their improvement.Battery:Battery is 7K mha but it is draining so fast that its overall backup time is slightly better than any other average phone.User Interface:User interface needs tremendous improvement. You can't take screenshot easily. You need to learn fine motor coordination between your fingers and power&volume button with microsecond precision. After three days I discovered taking screenshot by swapping screen. But this easy method for taking screenshot is not easy to find in its setting section. Automatic redial isn't available. also in setting section, searching for basic operation like redial, call waiting etc are either missing or very difficult to access. UI should be more intelligent and intuitive. Call recording should take permission from user before it starts recording any call.Dolby Sound:Dolby sound effect is excellent but its available only for external speaker. Inbuilt speaker don't have Dolby effect. You hv to buy headphone or external speaker for experiencing Dolby sound effect. Its Dolby software is so impressive that its work on a cheapest headphone but Samsung's own inbuilt speaker doesn't.External Outlook:Read somewhere that this phone has 3D prism like glastic body. GLASTIC seems to be a discovery of new material (Glass+Plastic) because its looks transparent and shining. But in reality, its a cheap looking smooth and slippery plastic back body. Also, Its prone to scratches neither its water resistant. Sometimes it generates heat. In this price segment, Samsung can easily provide metallic back for better appearance and transfer of heat.Overall, its good non chini phone with good camera and display, a bit bulky, satisfactory speed, scope of tremendous improvement in UI and setting, and bit overpriced.\",\n",

       "  'Ok so here comes the first review of this phone. Ordered on the first day of its sale and received on 3rd day. Indeed its a big and bulky phn but easy to handle. Few highlights:1. Seamless fingerprint scanner. I hv heard tht recent samsung phns have ths issue , however i dnt see any in ths phn. Its as gud as my past phns Asus 6z and Vivo v15pro. Side fingerprint scanner on the power button really makes it stylish and too easy to handle as well.2. Camera quality is really gud wth many features which luks tempting which im yet to explore. Even in dim light it scores quite well. Have all latest features like slow mo, 10x zoom, focus lens, panorma view and other added features.3. Battery ofcourse was the highlight while buying ths phn. I received this phn at 43%. And even after a rigorous 3 hr session of data transfer and apps installation it still holds at 33%. I believe it gonna last 2 days easily wth heavy net usage , mild games and gud 2 hrs of talk time.4. Luks wise it does seem premium despite a plastic back.5. Wonderful touch and a decent processimg speed. I tried playing 7-8 apps at the same time and it never hanged or lagged despite 50% memory up. Yet to try on heavy games though.6. Front cam does spoil the fun while watching full screen videos, like a small black dot bt can be lived wth.7. No headphones in the box.8. C to C charging cable capable of reverse charging too.Overall i wld rate it 4/5. Its one of the best non chinese phn available in the market for those who r luking for a huge battery wth a decent cam and light gaming purpose.Wld update on battery and cam after few days of usage',\n",

Trust me, this is the best and attractive colour I found ।l, blue is a good option too if you don't like a funky coloir।3. Camera I did not found upto the mark . Night mode is not that great but yes if you are a selfie person, go for it. I was using Ralme Xt earlier and it's camera was much better. But ok I will manage . I am a part time photographer and often I use my phone to click pics. Realme supported me a lot. Let's see how much Oppo supports.4. Speed is good. 6 GB 128 GB. Good combo. No lagging till now. Going smooth.5. Touch is awesome. Phone gets unlocks quickly. No lagging here too .Rest I will use for some more days and come back with my reviews again.\",\n",
       "  'i like the camera quality, images and videos are sharp and clear. there is a wee bit of noise in low light areas but it can be overlooked.it looks quite a bit like the iphone X but is largerdisplay is on par with iphone xmusic sounded as good as iphone xi could just unbox and get on with it as oppo provided the tempered glass, back cover as well. which was a pleasant surprise as I was not expecting. 😄Also the design, finger print sensor on display, face recognition .... lot of features.dual 4G standy by with an SD card is a blessing and I was looking for exactly what this phone offered at the right price and also the back cover made  of leather is so freaking rich and classy.quite happy with what I got. This is probably the fastest decision I have ever taken around buying a phone and I am hoping this will last long, like most of my other phones.',\n",
       "  \"So it's been three days since I'm using this phone and I'm completely in love with it at the price I got.1. Weight of the Phone is very less when compared to any phone in this segment and this matters a lot to me while carrying or casual music listening or any stuff.2. Back leather type wrapper is really good and gives a premium feel.3. UI is also good in terms of usage and mobile handling and compatibility4. Camera is decent for video calls/ normal phots not that great especially for shotting long-distance objects/ sceneries. But this doesn't matter to me a lot. Come on use a professional camera if you want photography at peaks.5. Design is excellent and it is the slimmest phone at 7.43mm6. Build Material quality is good.7. Sound is good but not that great for melodies or any songs please use earphones/headphones.8. Display is really good and it's out of my expectation as I'm using Samsung AMOLED previously.9. Processor is fast for general purpose and played COD and some other games at medium graphics didn't observe any lag.10. Battery is okay and keeps you charged up for one day (General usage with low- medium gaming)11. Software is fast and no clutter apps or extra apps.Overall I would definitely recommend if someone wants a nice phone for general usage which looks classy.\",\n",

Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money?

       "  'Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it\\'s hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let\\'s look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩\\xa0🇪\\xa0🇸\\xa0🇮\\xa0🇬\\xa0🇳\\xa0Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain \"cool\" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I\\'m touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩\\xa0🇮\\xa0🇸\\xa0🇵\\xa0🇱\\xa0🇦\\xa0🇾\\xa0The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone\\'s fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we\\'ve seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That\\'s slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don\\'t get fooled, it\\'s merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.',\n",

       "  'I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it\\'s expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like \"wow what a display\" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it\\'s clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn\\'t want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display\\'s blue light filter had issues I\\'m sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I\\'m keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it\\'s normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I\\'m tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It\\'s said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don\\'t like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn\\'t there). This shouldn\\'t be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.',\n",

You can pick Xiaomi’s own Redmi Note 9 (review) that gets points for its big battery, decent display and an above-average performance unitI bought it for youtube review but it changed me\",\n",

       "  'Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it\\'s hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let\\'s look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing🇩\\xa0🇪\\xa0🇸\\xa0🇮\\xa0🇬\\xa0🇳\\xa0Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain \"cool\" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I\\'m touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.🇩\\xa0🇮\\xa0🇸\\xa0🇵\\xa0🇱\\xa0🇦\\xa0🇾\\xa0The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone\\'s fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we\\'ve seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That\\'s slow, but then again, what else did you expect?🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don\\'t get fooled, it\\'s merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.',\n",

Even its plastic then also its feel solid yes it can take scratches easily so I will recommend you to buy a back cover for your smartphone.*Even mid range phone get scratches so easily*🤣2.Camera: now camera is the thing which many people likes and dislikes but in my opinion under 6k this camera is best talking about the front camera it is even impressive😮 the qualities actually true 5 megapixel.😎And the rear camera according to price its decent not so good but not so bad it's actually work fine with this budget category phone.😉According to me you cannot expect more than this in this price.👍3.Battery🔋: in today's smartphone battery is the major problem that it's not even last for a day but under the budget of 6k 3000 MaH battery is not bad.Under the moderate usage it can last upto a day.🗓️Battery is pretty decent.Performance✌️: this phone is powered by MediaTek helio a22 quad core processor which is clocked at speed of 2.0 gigahertz.And according to this price range this processor is good for this phone it can easily handle your daily work like social networking ,playing games medium graphic one, all other small works.you need to kept in mind that this phone price only 6,000 rupees so you cannot expect more than this.Now some people will say that 2GB RAM and 16GB storage is low and we cannot use this phone smoothly.But in my opinion if you want this phone for light use then this will not create problem for you.But for heavy users who wishes to play pubg on itThat's not for you guys! ☺️But you know the fun fact you can play pubg  on low graphic setting on this device!😆And also if you are that type of person who downloading apps and apps multiple apps on your smartphone Daily then this device is not for you.Display📲: under this price range this display is best nothing to say anything more(Important):-I read many reviews on Amazon and people are saying that the smartphone is bad its sound quality is not good, its battery backup is not good, its build quality is not good.According to me they want more in this price range but in my opinion you cannot get this much in 6k!In last let's take my verdict:If you want phone for lite useNot for heavy purpose then this phone is made for you.But in any case if you want a little better smartphone then this you can pay 1500 rupees extra and grab the realme c1.Real me C1 is also good value for money option for you yes you can play pubg on it.\",\n",
